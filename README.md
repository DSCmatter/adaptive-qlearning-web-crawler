# Adaptive Q-Learning Web Crawler with Contextual Bandits and GNNs

This project implements a **novel hybrid approach** to focused web crawling that combines three complementary techniques:

- **Q-Learning**: Provides high-level navigation strategy and long-term reward optimization
- **Contextual Bandits (LinUCB)**: Handles intelligent link selection with efficient exploration-exploitation balance
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Captures web graph structure for informed decision-making

The crawler learns to navigate the web by selecting links that maximize topical relevance while minimizing crawl cost. It receives rewards for discovering target-domain pages and penalties for inefficient navigation, enabling adaptive link selection over time. Its performance is evaluated against static heuristic-based crawlers and traditional RL approaches to analyze efficiency, coverage, and convergence behavior.

## 🔬 Research Innovation

This project addresses limitations in existing RL-based crawlers by:
- **Leveraging graph topology** via GNN-based node embeddings
- **Using contextual information** for faster convergence on link selection
- **Combining value-based and bandit approaches** for hierarchical decision-making
