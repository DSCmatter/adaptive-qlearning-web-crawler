# adaptive-qlearning-web-crawler

This project models focused web crawling as a reinforcement learning problem, where a Q-learning agent learns to navigate the web by selecting links that maximize topical relevance while minimizing crawl cost. The crawler receives rewards for discovering target-domain pages and penalties for inefficient navigation, enabling adaptive link selection over time. Its performance is evaluated against static heuristic-based crawlers to analyze efficiency, coverage, and convergence behavior.
